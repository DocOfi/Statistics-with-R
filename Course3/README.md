#### Course Description

This repository contains my course project submitted through GitHub for the course Linear Regression and Modeling in Coursera. Linear Regression and Modeling is course 3 of 5 in the [Statistics with R Specialization]("https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics"). 



This course introduces the learner to sampling and exploring data, as well as basic probability theory. The learner will examine various types of sampling methods and discuss how such methods can impact the utility of a data analysis. The concepts in this module will serve as building blocks for our later courses.

# Introduction

For this course the learner will develop a multiple linear regression model that will explain what makes movies popular given the variables in a dataset provided

The data provided comes from a random sample of movies which includes information from [Rotten Tomatoes]("http://www.rottentomatoes.com/") and  Internet Movie Database [IMDB]("http://www.imdb.com/").

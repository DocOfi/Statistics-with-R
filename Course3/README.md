### Course Description

**About this course:** This course introduces simple and multiple linear regression models. These models allow you to assess the relationship between variables in a data set and a continuous response variable. Is there a relationship between the physical attractiveness of a professor and their student evaluation scores? Can we predict the test score for a child based on certain characteristics of his or her mother? In this course, you will learn the fundamental theory behind linear regression and, through data examples, learn to fit, examine, and utilize regression models to examine relationships between multiple variables, using the free statistical software R and RStudio. *from* ttps://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-regression-model/

### Course Project

For this course the learner will develop a multiple linear regression model that will explain what makes movies popular given the variables in a dataset provided

The data provided comes from a random sample of movies which includes information from [Rotten Tomatoes]("http://www.rottentomatoes.com/") and  Internet Movie Database [IMDB]("http://www.imdb.com/").

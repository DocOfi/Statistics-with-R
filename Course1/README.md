### Course Description

**About this course:** This course introduces you to sampling and exploring data, as well as basic probability theory and Bayes' rule. You will examine various types of sampling methods, and discuss how such methods can impact the scope of inference. A variety of exploratory data analysis techniques will be covered, including numeric summary statistics and basic data visualization. You will be guided through installing and using R and RStudio (free statistical software), and will use this software for lab exercises and a final project. The concepts and techniques in this course will serve as building blocks for the inference and modeling courses in the Specialization. 

### Course project

The course project for this course will require the learner to identify a research question and use the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ([BRFSS]("http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/")) dataset to answer the reserch question. The project is designed to help you discover and explore research questions of your own, using real data and statistical methods we learn in this class. The the project will be graded via peer assessments, meaning that you will need to evaluate three peers' projects after submitting your own.

### Research questions

<p style="color: darkblue">Research quesion 2<p>: Is there an association between being diagnosed with heart attack and Body Mass Index among responders who were told they were diabetics?

<p style="color: darkblue">Research quesion 3<p>: Is there an association between chronological age and being told that diabetes has affected the eyes among responders who were told they were diabetics?

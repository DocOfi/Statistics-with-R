### My course project in the Bayesian Statistics Course in Coursera


This repository contains my Capstone project submitted through GitHub for the Bayesian Statistics course in the [Statistics with R Specialization]("https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics").

### Course Description

**About this course:** This course describes Bayesian statistics, in which one's inferences about parameters or hypotheses are updated as evidence accumulates. You will learn to use Bayes' rule to transform prior probabilities into posterior probabilities, and be introduced to the underlying theory and perspective of the Bayesian paradigm. The course will apply Bayesian methods to several practical problems, to show end-to-end Bayesian analyses that move from framing the question to building models to eliciting prior probabilities to implementing in R (free statistical software) the final posterior distribution. Additionally, the course will introduce credible regions, Bayesian comparisons of means and proportions, Bayesian regression and inference using multiple models, and discussion of Bayesian prediction.

We assume learners in this course have background knowledge equivalent to what is covered in the earlier three courses in this specialization: "Introduction to Probability and Data," "Inferential Statistics," and "Linear Regression and Modeling. *from* https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian

### Course Project

For this course project the learner will take the role of a data scientist hired to develop a Bayesian regression model to predict movie popularity using explanatory variables in the dataset provided.

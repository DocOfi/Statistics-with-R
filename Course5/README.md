### Course Description

This course puts the skills the learner has acquired and the methods he's learned in the previous courses into a thorough data analysis project using real data to answer a concrete business problem.

### Course Project

For this course project the learner will take the role of a consultant hired by a real estate investment firm in Ames, Iowa, a mid-west town in the United States, to analyze data in order to help provide insight into how the firm should invest for highest profits, and to quantify and communicate to the company management what types of real estate properties are good investments and why. 

They have provided you with data on housing sales from between 2006 to 2010 that contains information about the characteristics of the house (number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage, etc.) and the house's sale price. The company that hired you has many questions for you about the housing market. It is up to you to decide what methods you want to use (frequentist or Bayesian) to answer these questions, and implement them.
